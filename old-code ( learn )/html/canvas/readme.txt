'yourElementId': Replace this with the actual id attribute value of the HTML element you want to select.



ye man aur Samman batao
Jivan ke apman batao 
Jivan mrutyu kya hai Keshav 
Ran Mein Jivan Dan batao 
Kam Krodh Ki Baat Kari To Mujhko Uttam kam batao 
aur Khud Ko Ishwar Kahate ho to jaldi Apna Naam batao
